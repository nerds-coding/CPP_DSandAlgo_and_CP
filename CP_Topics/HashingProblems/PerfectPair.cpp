/*Rajiv and Nitish had a fight because Rajiv was annoying Nitish with his question.
Rajiv being a genius in arrays gave Nitish an array of natural numbers A of length N
with elements A1,  A2, . . ., AN. Nitish has to find the total amount of perfect pairs in the array.
A perfect pair (Ai, Aj) is a pair where (Ai + Aj) is a perfect square or a perfect cube and i â‰  j. 
Since Rajiv and Nitish are not talking with each other after the fight you have been given 
the question to solve and inturn make both of them a perfect pair again.
NOTE :-  A pair (Ai, Aj) and (Aj, Ai) are same and not to be counted twice.*/
