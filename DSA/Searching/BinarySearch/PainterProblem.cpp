/*Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integars C of size N.

Element C[i] represents length of ith board.

You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1]. 
There are A painters available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of board.

Calculate and return minimum time required to paint all 
boards under the constraints that any painter will only 
paint contiguous sections of board.*/
